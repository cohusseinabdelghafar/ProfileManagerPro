        <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
        
        <p><em>Last Updated: July 12, 2025</em></p>
        
        <p>Thank you for choosing Profile Manager Pro ("we", "us", or "our"). This Privacy Policy is designed to be clear and transparent about how we handle your data. Our core principle is to protect your privacy by processing all data locally on your device.</p>
        
        <h2>1. Data We Handle (and What We Don't)</h2>
        
        <p>Profile Manager Pro operates entirely on your local device. We do <strong>not</strong> collect, transmit, or store any of your personal data on external servers.</p>
        
        <p>The extension requires access to the following data, which is stored exclusively in your browser's local storage (`localStorage`):</p>
        
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Profile Configuration Data</strong>: This includes the names, settings, and configurations of the browser profiles you create. This data is essential for the extension to function.</li>
            <li><strong>Cookie Data</strong>: To manage and switch between profiles effectively, the extension needs to interact with your browser's cookies. All cookie handling is done locally.</li>
            <li><strong>User Preferences</strong>: Any settings you configure within the extension, such as themes or preferences, are saved locally.</li>
        </ul>
        
        <h2>2. How We Use Your Information</h2>
        
        <p>The data we access is used solely for the following purposes:</p>
        
        <ul>
            <li>To provide the core functionality of creating, managing, and switching between browser profiles.</li>
            <li>To save and persist your settings and preferences for a consistent user experience.</li>
            <li>To ensure seamless and reliable operation of the extension on your device.</li>
        </ul>
        
        <h2>3. Data Storage, Security, and Your Rights</h2>
        
        <p>All data is stored locally on your computer using secure browser storage mechanisms. You have full control over your data.</p>
        
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Right to Access</strong>: You can inspect all data stored by the extension at any time through your browser's developer tools (in the `localStorage` section).</li>
            <li><strong>Right to Erasure (Deletion)</strong>: You can delete your data at any time. Uninstalling the extension will permanently remove all associated data from your device.</li>
            <li><strong>Right to Rectification</strong>: You can modify your profile configurations and settings directly within the extension's interface.</li>
        </ul>
        
        <h2>4. Compliance with GDPR and CCPA</h2>
        
        <p>While Profile Manager Pro does not transmit data to servers, we are committed to upholding the principles of major data privacy regulations:</p>
        
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Lawful Basis for Processing</strong>: The legal basis for handling your data is its necessity for the functioning of the extension, which you install and use at your discretion.</li>
            -
            <li><strong>Data Minimization</strong>: We only handle the minimum amount of data required for the extension to work.</li>
        </ul>
        
        <h2>5. Third-Party Services</h2>
        
        <p>Profile Manager Pro is a self-contained extension. It does <strong>not</strong> integrate with or share data with any third-party services, analytics platforms, or advertisers.</p>
        
        <h2>6. Changes to This Privacy Policy</h2>
        
        <p>We may update this Privacy Policy to reflect changes in our practices or for other operational, legal, or regulatory reasons. We will notify you of any significant changes by updating the "Last Updated" date on this page.</p>
