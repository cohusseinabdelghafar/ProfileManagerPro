# Google Search Console Indexing Fix

## Problem
Google Search Console detected "alternative page with proper canonical tag" for:
- https://profilemanager.pro/index.html

This means Google found duplicate content between your main domain and the /index.html version.

## Solution Implemented

### 1. Updated robots.txt
- Added `Disallow: /index.html` to prevent crawling of the index.html URL

### 2. Server Redirects (Choose based on your hosting)

#### For Apache Hosting (.htaccess)
- 301 redirect from /index.html to /
- HTTPS enforcement
- Security headers
- Cache control

#### For Netlify (netlify.toml)
- 301 redirect with force flag
- Security headers

#### For Vercel (vercel.json)
- 301 redirect configuration
- Security headers

#### For Generic Hosting (_redirects)
- Simple redirect rules

### 3. Updated Sitemap
- Updated lastmod dates to current date
- Ensured only canonical URLs are included

## Next Steps

1. **Upload the appropriate redirect file** based on your hosting:
   - Apache: Use `.htaccess`
   - Netlify: Use `netlify.toml`
   - Vercel: Use `vercel.json`
   - Other: Use `_redirects`

2. **Test the redirects**:
   ```bash
   curl -I https://profilemanager.pro/index.html
   ```
   Should return 301 redirect to https://profilemanager.pro/

3. **Submit updated sitemap** to Google Search Console

4. **Request re-indexing** in Google Search Console:
   - Go to URL Inspection
   - Enter: https://profilemanager.pro/index.html
   - Click "Request Indexing" (it should now show as redirected)

5. **Monitor for 2-4 weeks** for the issue to resolve

## Expected Results
- /index.html will redirect to /
- Google will recognize the canonical URL
- The "alternative page with proper canonical tag" issue will resolve
- Only https://profilemanager.pro/ will be indexed

## Verification
After implementing, verify:
1. https://profilemanager.pro/index.html redirects to https://profilemanager.pro/
2. robots.txt shows the disallow rule
3. Canonical tag remains pointing to https://profilemanager.pro/
4. Google Search Console shows the redirect in URL inspection
